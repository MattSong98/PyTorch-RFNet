### INSTALLATION GUIDE ###

1. cd PyTorch_RFNet

2. get dataset BRATS2020 here (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AwLwGgEBQwesIDTlWpubbwqxxd8brt5A?usp=sharing) and unzip it under the project folder PyTorch-RFNet [tar -xzf BRATS2020_Training_none_npy.tar.gz]

3. rename the BRATS2020 folder as "data" [mv BRATS2020_Training_none_npy data]

4. open job.sh and change PYTHONPATH to the correct project path (eg. "~/Desktop/PyTorch-RFNet")

5. run the script [bash job.sh]

notes: you should have CUDA & PyTorch Installed in your environment. However, you don't have to worry about the version. (any common version will work)
